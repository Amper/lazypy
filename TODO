Things to do with lazypy
==========================

Overdue items and bugs
--------------------------


Near future plans
--------------------------

Make "futures" more usefull for SMP machines by implementing a variation
that uses processes instead of threads. For communication I can port over
the tuple spaces from Toolserver and make them run in shared memory. That
way there is a good asynchronous communication package available and due
to process isolation the processes don't stomp each others data so easily.

Far future plans
--------------------------

- try to get a better solution for setattr on Promise instances
